## General info
In this problem, it is useful to use cylindrical polar coordinates (s; phi; z). As the current through the
wire changes in an arbitrary way, the wire acts as an antenna and emits electromagnetic waves. One can
convince oneself that the resulting electric field has only a z-component and depends on only s and t i.e.
Ez(s; t), similarly, B(s; t). You are expected to write a program (e.g. in C) which takes I(t) as an input
and provides Ez(s; t) and B(s; t) as the output.
